# Nicolas' tips

I use this repository to conveniently store tips for future reference. Some of
them might be useful to others. They cover various areas, mostly related to Linux software as I work on Ubuntu mostly. 

I encourage you to open issues if you find bugs or possible improvements to
these notes.
